# LinkLearn - Virtual Assistant Project

## Overview

**LinkLearn** is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to assist users with various tasks through voice commands. Built with a user-friendly interface and integrated with speech synthesis and speech recognition APIs, this project enables users to interact with the assistant in a conversational manner. Whether it's opening websites, checking the time or date, or responding to user queries, LinkLearn makes digital interaction seamless.

**Deployed Project**: [Virtual Assistant](https://virtualassistant.noteslink.in/)

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: The assistant listens to your commands via a microphone and responds accordingly.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Provides verbal responses to user inputs.
- **Web Navigation**: Opens popular websites such as YouTube, Google, Facebook, and more on voice commands.
- **Time & Date**: Fetches and announces the current time or date.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Searches the web for queries that are beyond predefined commands.

## How It Works

1. The user interacts with the virtual assistant by pressing a button and speaking commands.
2. The assistant processes the voice input and performs actions based on recognized keywords.
3. If a recognized action matches a command, the corresponding task (like opening a website) is performed.
4. For queries without a predefined answer, the assistant will search the web for relevant information.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the front-end structure, including buttons and display elements for the virtual assistant.
- `style.css`: Provides the visual styling for the assistant, creating an intuitive and attractive user interface.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling voice commands, processing user inputs, and performing corresponding actions.
- `logo.jpg`: The logo for the virtual assistant, displayed on the website.
- `mic.svg`: The microphone icon used in the button for starting the speech recognition process.
- `voice.gif`: An animated gif that visualizes the voice recognition process.
